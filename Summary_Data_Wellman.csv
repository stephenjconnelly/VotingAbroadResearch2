 OLD NOTES: ""Total Sufragantes Formato E-11"" = ""Eligible Populations""; (1) For each row, I combined the values for ""Votos No Marcados"" and ""Votos Nulos"" to get the result for null votes; (2) To get the total results for a consulate, I add the values for each column from each puesto (e.g. puestos 2, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, and 86 for Baku, Azerbaijan. Also, it is important to note that the sum of puestos 81 - 86 does NOT equal the tally for puesto 2; (3) Note: ""Promotores Voto en Blanca"" does NOT equal the total number of blank votes. The former is its own party; (4) In this spreadsheet, I disregard the values for ""total votos en la urna"" and ""total votos incinerados."" Instead, for our column for ""total votes,"" I use the ballot's ""total votos de la mesa"" value.
